Features-
This widget provides a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance web accessibility:

Visual Adjustments-
 â€¢ Contrast+: Increases the color contrast of the page for better readability.

Page Structure: Outlines all heading elements (h1-h6) to provide a clear structural overview of the page.

Tech Stack-
 â€¢ Framework: React (with Hooks)

 â€¢ Build Tool: Vite

 â€¢ Styling: Plain CSS with CSS Variables (No frameworks like Tailwind CSS)

 â€¢ Icons: Lucide React

 â€¢ Deployment: Vercel

Implementation Choices Explained-
 This section details the key technical decisions made during the development of the widget.

  â€¢ React + Vite: Vite was chosen as the build tool for its incredibly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), leading to a superior development experience. React provides a robust component-based architecture, making     the UI modular and easy to manage.

  â€¢ Plain CSS with CSS Variables: Instead of a utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS, this project uses plain CSS. This choice was made to eliminate complex setup and configuration steps, ensuring maximum         compatibility and simplicity. CSS Variables (--var-name) are used extensively to maintain a consistent theme.

  â€¢ localStorage for Persistence: To remember a user's chosen settings across sessions, localStorage is used. This is a simple, effective, client-side solution that doesn't require any backend infrastructure.

  â€¢ Dynamic Style Injection via <style> Tag: All accessibility modifications to the host page are applied by a single JavaScript function that dynamically writes CSS rules into a <style> tag in the document's         <head>. This is a highly efficient method for applying global changes without needing to toggle dozens of individual classes on the <body> element.

  â€¢ JavaScript for Dynamic Positioning: The feature where the floating button moves to avoid the footer cannot be achieved with CSS alone due to the nature of position: fixed. Therefore, a useEffect hook in           App.jsx adds a scroll event listener to monitor the footer's position and dynamically adds/removes a class to move the button, creating a responsive and intelligent UI behavior.
